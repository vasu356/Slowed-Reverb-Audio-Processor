# Slowed Reverb Audio Processor
 This project automates the process of slowing down and adding reverb to MP3 files using SoX (Sound eXchange). It processes all MP3 files in a specified input directory, applies a slowdown effect and reverb, and saves the modified audio files in the output directory. Ideal for creating slowed and reverbed music tracks.
